LORDS 35 vs CKATT 73 (NPH Showcase) | Full Game Replay | October 27, 2024

The Lords U14 lose their opening match in the NPH Showcase league against rivals CKATT who have won all their head-to-heads this year. The opening half started strong with the Lords team being able to keep up with CKATT before the first timeout of the game. Unfortunately after that it was all CKATT going on to a 30-6 run before half-time. The lopsided game continued in the second half with CKATT taking that half of the game as well.

Kenneth and Indmir led the scoring effort with 9 and 8 points respectively. Strong effort with rebounding on both offensive and defensive glass with Indmir contributing 9 of the 27 rebounds overall. However, it was a tough game characterized by too many turnovers (15 in total) which did not help the already poor field goal percentage of the team (12-for-31; 38.7%) compared to CKATTs hot shooting (33-for-49; 67.3%).

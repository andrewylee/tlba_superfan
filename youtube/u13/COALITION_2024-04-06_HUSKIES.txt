NORTH TORONTO HUSKIES 49 vs LORDS 44 (COALITION PLAYOFFS) | Full Game Replay | April 6, 2024

A disappointing end to the 2024 Coalition season with a first round exit at the hands of the North Toronto Huskies after leading for the first three quarters of the game. Allowing the Huskies to go on a fourth quarter 9-0 run was a key turning point which caused the team to lose much of their momentum!

Overall the Lords team shot well from the free-throw line, but half the team was in foul trouble. Defensive discipline was lacking with a number of un-called for fouls which allowed the Huskies 25 more free throw attempts during the game. Perhaps this was due to the pre-longed competitive break the team somehow managed during March - this was the first competitive game since March 3rd! 

Adam K. led scoring overall with 11 points and Zach followed-up with 6 points. The rest of the scoring was pretty distributed throughout the rest of the team. Strong defensive effort by Adrian with 4 steals and 1 block which contributed to his team high +8 Plus/Minus for the game.

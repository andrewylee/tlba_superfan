VAUGHAN PANTHERS 80 vs LORDS 53 (COALITION) | Full Game Replay | March 3, 2024

The Lords Rep team was short handed with a few players missing this game and fell to the Vaughan Panthers 80-43. The Lords team never gave up though despite the uphill challenge and Xavier scored a beautiful mid-court buzzer beater to end the second quarter (see highlight at 28:32 into the game).

The game story was all about turnovers... with the Lords team committing 33 of them as a team with the increased speed and tempo that the Vaughan team forced! Despite a few stretches in the game where Vaughan went on runs, the Lords team managed to keep pace with the better Panthers team even though missing their top points scorer this season. 

Xavier led team scoring with 13 points followed by both Alex and Zach who chipped in 9 points each as well. The rest of the team stood up to take on the extra scoring responsibilities. Also a shoutout to Zach who came close to earning a double double on his efforts.

CKATT 65 vs LORDS 47 (COALITION) | Full Game Replay | February 17, 2024

Another slow start by the Lords U13 Gold Rep team in this rematch against CKaTT was a significant contributor the 65-47 loss. While the slow start was not as bad as the last time they played each other early on in the OBA season, the CKaTT team built up a commanding lead 18-5 after the first quarter. It was more evenly played in the rest of the game however the Lords team end up losing by 17 after giving up a 13 point lead to start the game. The speed of play and mastery of the Eurostep by the CKaTT team gave the Lords team much trouble. Add in their height amd size advantage and it's no surprise the defensive struggles the Lords team faced in rebounding (21 to 9 for offensive boards). An overall good effort in trying to keep up with the CKaTT team, however the poor start was too big of a hole to dig out of!

Adam K. led the scoring for the Lords team with 14 points (shooting 100% from the free throw line and swishing two 3-pointers), and Xavier was second leading contributor with 10 points overall. Great shooting from the 3-point line by the team with 7 made 3's - contributed by Sen, Adam K., Leo, Xavier, Adrian, and Julian. Also, check out the pretty highlight play that Zach had at 28:21 üëÄ

LORDS 39 vs THE UNIT 44 (THE BATTLE UN1TED TOURNAMENT) | Full Game Replay | June 1, 2024

The Lords U13 Summer team lose a close one to Buffalo‚Äôs The Unit in their opening game of The Battle United Tournament. The Lords team came out strong and were up 24-17 after the first half. The momentum swung over to The Unit after an unfortunate Technical which allowed them to shoot 3/4 from the line and close in the scoring deficit within striking distance. Ultimately the Lords team were not able to get their scoring going again and lose by 5 at the buzzer.

Leo led scoring overall on the team with 8 points and was followed closely by Adam and Kenneth with 7 points each. A strong defensive effort by Brandon and Leo with 5 and 3 steals respectively. The addition of Kenneth to the team really showed up in our rebounding stats (11 offensive; 29 rebounds) with 9 of those attributed to him directly! The Lords team needs to pay closer attention to better protect the ball and reduce the 22 turnovers they had in this match.

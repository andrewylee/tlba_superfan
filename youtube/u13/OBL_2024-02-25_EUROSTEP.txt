LORDS 2 vs EUROSTEP 0 - FORFEIT (OBL) | Full Game Replay | February 25, 2024

A strange end to the match during the third quarter when Eurostep's coach was ejected by the head referee and had to forfeit the game. The Lords U13 Gold Rep team was in full control of the game up to that point leading 36-27 in the final game of the four-game OBL weekend. The Gold Rep had a hot start taking an early 11-2 lead before ending the first quarter up 12-4. The Eurostep team showed signs of life in the second closing the lead to just 1 point before the Lords team responded back with their own run to cap off the 2nd quarter and taking in a 29-19 to half time. The third quarter was relatively back and forth until Eurostep forfeited the game due to bad behaviour by their head coach.

In terms of scoring, Brandon led the team with 13 points followed by Adam K. with 11. Strong defensive effort by Leo who contributed 7 of the 17 steals in the three quarters played. Team shot 63.6% from the line (7-11). Lords team was challenged in controlling rebounds where Eurostep had a distinct advantage due to their height compared to the Lords team - grabbing 20 vs 18 rebounds for them (13 to 8 on the offensive glass).

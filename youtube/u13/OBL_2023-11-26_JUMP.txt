LORDS 53 vs JUMP BASKETBALL 54 (OBL) | Full Game Replay | November 26, 2023

A nail-biter of a game where the Toronto Lords U13 Rep team lose their opening OBA regular season match to Jump Basketball 53-54. Although the Lords team were missing a couple of their players, the game was a highly contested, back-and-forth match until the 3rd Quarter when the Jump leaped ahead with a 13 point lead. The Lords team came back roaring in the 4th and retaking the lead for a while, however they could not hold on at the end... losing by a point.

The U13's had a tough shooting game with shooting percentages for field goals, 3-pointers, and free throws all below their team norms. Adam K. led the way in terms of team scoring contributing 18 points. Great defensive effort by Adam, Xavier, and Adrian with a combined 15 steals during the game.

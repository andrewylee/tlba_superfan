BARRIE ROYALS 61 vs LORDS 38 (COALITION) | Full Game Replay | January 20, 2023

The Barrie Royals defeat the Toronto Lords U13 Gold team 61-38 in the second Coalition League game of 2024. The Lords team was playing with a short bench with a couple of their players out due to illness. The Lords U13 team kept it close during the first quarter, however the Barrie Royals had a monster 2nd quarter run which put the rest of the game out of reach for any sort of comeback. Overall, a tough day for the Lords U13 team in terms of shooting and finishing around the rim... the Royals defense and size were a big factor that contributed to the troubles.

Brandon had a super strong game and contributed 15 points (including 100% from the free throw line), followed by Xavier with 11 points.

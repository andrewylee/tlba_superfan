The U12 team started slowly finding their energy back after a long break post their first game of the day. Coach turned over two shifts for the whole game and at half-time the team was down 23-11 caused primarily by missing their first 13 shots and finding clean quality shots. The second half of the game was a turnaround job by asserting strong defence and efficient scoring to slowly climb back into contention and eventually taking over the lead in the fourth.

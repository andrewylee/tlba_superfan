MISSISSAUGA MONARCHS 56 vs LORDS 48 (Coalition) | Full Game Replay | December 11, 2022

The Lords U12 team ended their Coalition weekend games with a defeat to the Missisauga Monarchs 56-48, on Sunday December 11th, 2022. While the U12 team put up a competitive fight against the Monarchs over the first 3 quarters (close back and forth game), the Lords team ultimately could not cope with the final 4th quarter surge by the Monarchs. This is a marked improvement, compared to last year, when the Lords Rep team consistently lost to the Monarchs and could not handle their signature swarming defensive schemes.

This was a game where the two Adam's poured on the bulk of scoring for the U12 team - Adam K. leading the way with 11 points and Adam M. contributing 9 as well. Defensively Sydney kept the team in the game by hauling down 9 defensive rebounds, however the high number of turnovers (38) ultimately caught up to the Lords U12 team!

RWI KINGS 38 vs LORDS 53 (Coalition) | Full Game Replay | December 11, 2022

The Toronto Lords U12 Rep team breaks their recent slump by bouncing back with a convincing win over the RWI Kings 53-38, on Sunday December 11th, 2022.  The Lords U12 team started off the game timid and were down 8-points going into half-time. However, an in-game adjustment by Coach Scott to blitz the Kings at the beginning of the 3rd Quarter was effective and the Lords team went on a 19-3 run, taking full control over the game and never looking back.

Adam K. and Xavier led scoring with 14 points each, with Sydney closely contributing 11 points himself. Special shout-out to Zach who pulled down 20 rebounds during the game (7 offensive + 13 defensive) üôå!

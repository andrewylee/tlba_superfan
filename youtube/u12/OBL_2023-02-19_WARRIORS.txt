LORDS 37 vs BRAMPTON WARRIORS 40 (OBL) | Full Game Replay | February 19, 2023

The Lords U12 drop the first game to the Brampton Warriors 37-40 on Sunday February 19th, 2023 post the re-shuffling of the OBL "Pool C" bracket after the first series of games in the new year. 

Another slow start for the U12's with both shifts losing their opening quarter match-ups. The team struggled generating offensive flow but did clean-up their turnovers compared to more recent games. Many unforced errors including lane violations, errant / missed passes or catches, and travels. Second quarter the team started to rally and closed the gap to 3 by mid-game. The big difference was in offensive rebounds where they had 26 while the Lords U12 only grabbed 8, translating into 22 extra shots. This coupled with 42.9% shooting on the line was what contributed coming short 3 points in the end.

A very strong game by Xavier who chipped in close to half the offense with 17 points. Sydney had 6 points along with 12 boards and a couple of blocks. Rest of the team chipped in 2 to 4 points to round out the scoring.
